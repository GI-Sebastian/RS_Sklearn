This repository will be a collection of scripts frequently used for remote
sensing applications.

For example, the 'rasterstack.py' file contains a function to stack several
GeoTiff raster files to a single  GeoTiff file. This stack can be used to
visualize a satellite scene in GIS software, like QGIS or SAGA GIS.
